# An app is what will have pages and views and represent your site. Whereas the project is kind of an environment that runs your app!

* Urls.py in main is what connects to the different view page of main/views.py
* if user doesn't put anything in the url it automatically redirects to the home page of views.index
* In the project url part an empty path is your default page - like a landing page
* In the project setting file, adding main.apps. MainConfig under the installed apps,
tells django to look for apps in main folder and configured and updated when modifications are made.
*path("<int:id>", views.index, name="index") id of list
path("<str:name>", views.index, name="index") name of list
